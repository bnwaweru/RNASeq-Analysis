## Background of Experiment

##### Objective

The goal of the experiment was to find whether there are genes that are
differentially expressed between cultivars of grass species under study
in response to aluminum present in the soil.

##### Design

There were 2 cultivars (Basilisk and Marandu) each with a treatment
(aluminium /lime) and control. For each treatment, there were 4
biological samples per cultivar with 3 technical replications per
sample. For the biological sample, four root samples were collected from
one plot of each of the cultivars (Basilisk, Marandu) one treated with
lime, and one from a plot not treated with lime i.e the control. So for
each cultivar, we had 8 biological samples. From each of the eight
samples, three different nucleic acid extraction was done, i.e three lab
technical replicates, leading to 24 samples per cultivar, 12 from a plot
treated with lime and 12 from a control. A total of 48 samples were
submitted for sequencing, which were sequenced in two pools.
